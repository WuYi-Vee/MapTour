## Problem

- People often have to swtich between various apps and websites when planning a trip
  - Booking transportation can be tricky since different modes (like flights, trains, or buses) require separate apps
  - Even for the same type of transportation, prices and schedules can vary across platforms (like *spirit*, *expedia*, *frontier*...) 
  - Finding accommodation options can be a hassle too, with each site offering different types of stays at varying prices
  - Ticket purchase methods/websites are different for each attraction
  - Turn to social media apps for inspiration on where to go next
- Use map application to filter accommodation and attractions as well as make travel plans



## Solution

- A method for creating travel guide directly from map. 
  - Users can choose accomodation and attractions directly on the map, instead of checking their location after picking them
  - User can first filter accommodation or attractions based on their preferences, and all matching options will appear on the map. This way, they can pick the most conveniently located places right away.
  - After selecting accommodation or attractions on the map, users can click a link to book directly though the official site.
  - Confirmed selections will be pinned on the map, making it easier to choose additional attractions later.
  - Once the guide is complete, the app automatically generates a full travel itinerary for easy reference.
  - To add a social element, users can share their forever-ready travel guides in the community. Others can then tweak these shared guides to quickly create their own personalized itineraries.
- To avoid the hassle of switching between different apps, we can centralize all the information from various platforms and provide direct links to the official sites for easy booking.

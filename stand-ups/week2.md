## Week2

### The thing I have done in past week:

- List the problem that the porject needs to solve:
  - People often have to switch between various apps and websites when planning a trip
  - Use a map app to filter accommodations, attractions and make travel routines


- The corresponding solutions are:
  - Our project propose a method for creating travel guide directly from map:
    - Users can choose accomodation and attractions directly on the map, instead of checking their location after picking them
    - User can first filter accommodation or attractions based on their preferences, and all matching options will appear on the map. This way, they can pick the most conveniently located places right away.
    - After selecting accommodation or attractions on the map, users can click a link to book directly though the official site.
    - Confirmed selections will be pinned on the map, making it easier to choose additional attractions later.
    - Once the guide is complete, the app automatically generates a full travel itinerary for easy reference.
    - To add a social element, users can share their forever-ready travel guides in the community. Others can then tweak these shared guides to quickly create their own personalized itineraries.
  - To avoid the hassle of switching between different apps, we can centralize all the information from various platforms and provide direct links to the official sites for easy booking.

### Challenges/Blockers encountered in the past week:

- I am trying to visualize the process of "making a travel guide on a map" in the form of picture or animations, but I'm unsure which software or website to use.



### The thing I will do in the next week:

- Investigate how to create pictures and animations of software programs that are still in the concept stage.
- Try to visualize the process of "making a travle guide on a map"

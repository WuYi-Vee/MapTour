## Week3

### The thing I have done in past week:

- The main thing I have done is to visualize my idea about apps or website with integrated travel planning features.

### Challenges/Blockers encountered in the past week:

- I originally intended to visualize my ideas using images or animations, but I'm not a design professional so I find it inefficient to drawing directly. Since I plan to develop an app or a webpage for this functionality, I can directly use screen recording to demonstrate the features after the development is complete.
- I initially thought of developing an iOS app directly, because app is more convinient to use and my phone is IOS system. However, since my computer is a Windows PC, setting up the development environment would require considerable effort. Given that I already have experience in web development, I plan to start by visualizing my ideas through a webpage first.



### The thing I will do in the next week:

- Develop the front end using JavaScript and integrate the Google Maps JavaScript API to create the basic webpage.

## Week1

### The thing I have done in past week:

- step up the github repository of the project and do some maintenance activities like create the folder for every week stand-ups
- write the report of the repository
- determine the topic of the project: develop a map-based travel guide application to help users make and plan travel routes on the map more conveniently. (motivation: When I made travel plan, including booking hotels and determining the spots, I always needed to switch to many applications and determine the location of hotel and spots. It is very unconvenient.)



### Challenges/Blockers encountered in the past week:

- When I wanted to sychronize changes of local git repository with a remote repository on Github, I fail to do that. The problem is that I forgot to pull branch to local repository 

  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

  

### The thing I will do in the next week:

- refine the project, including problem, solution, key metric, etc.

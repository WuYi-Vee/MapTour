## Week3

### The thing I have done in past week:

- integrated the Google Map JavaScript API into my webpage

### Challenges/Blockers encountered in the past week:

- I've forgotten the syntax of HTML and JavaScript, because I haven't used them for a long time.
  - I need to review the syntax while writing the code (Once I get back into the syntax, I'm sure I can code faster.)

- fail to integrated API at first
  - I searched for code syntax errors for a long time and finally found that it was because the Google Map API service in Google Cloud Console is not enabled.




### The thing I will do in the next week:

- I will customize the Guide class, which represents a travel guide and is used to store user travel guide information. It also makes it easier for users to view and share the guide.
